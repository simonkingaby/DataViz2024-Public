## Homebrew Sudo Access
If you get a prompt on the Mac that says you need sudo access, this is ok. At the enter your password prompt, you will type the regular account password that you use to log in to the Mac. Note: There will be no visual feedback as you type it. Just type it in and press enter and it should allow Homebrew to make all the changes it needs to make.

# Working with Git
Git is a source code manager (SCM). This type of tool is used to store and share source code projects and files, and it will often have features for managing the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using either a Waterfall or Agile development methodology.

## GitHub
*GitHub is where you will put your homework files, where you will collaborate with your classmates, etc.*

*It is also where you will find the bonus material that I post in my [DataViz2024-Public](https://github.com/simonkingaby/DataViz2024-Public) repository.*

## GitLab
*[GitLab](https://git.bootcampcontent.com/UNC-Chapel-Hill/UNC-VIRT-DATA-PT-06-2024-U-LOLC) is where you will find your class activity files, homework assignments, etc. It will be a readonly repository.*
